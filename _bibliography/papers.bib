  title={LatentCLR: A Contrastive Learning Approach for Unsupervised Discovery of Interpretable Directions},
  author={Yuksel*, Oguz Kaan and Simsar*, Enis and Er,Ezgi Gulperi and Yanardag, Pinar},
  abstract={Recent research has shown great potential for finding interpretable directions in the latent spaces of pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These directions provide controllable generation and support a wide range of semantic editing operations such as zoom or rotation. The discovery of such directions is often performed in a supervised or semi-supervised fashion and requires manual annotations,  limiting their applications in practice. In comparison, unsupervised discovery enables finding subtle directions a priori hard to recognize. In this work, we propose a contrastive-learning-based approach for discovering semantic directions in the latent space of pretrained GANs in a self-supervised manner. Our approach finds semantically meaningful dimensions compatible with state-of-the-art methods.},

  title={StyleMC: Multi-Channel Based Fast Text-Guided Image Generation and Manipulation},
  author={Umut Kocasari and Alara Dirik and Mert Tiftikci and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Pre-trained GANs have shown great potential for interpretable directions in the latent space. The discovery of such directions is often done in a supervised or self-supervised manner and requires manual annotations which limits their application in practice. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches provide a way to discover interpretable directions without any supervision, but no fine-grained attribute can be discovered. Recent work such as StyleCLIP aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging the power of CLIP, a joint representational model for text and images, for text-driven image manipulation. While promising, these methods take several hours of pre-processing or training time, and require multiple text prompts. In this work, we propose a fast and efficient method for text-guided image generation and manipulation by leveraging the power of StyleGAN2 and CLIP. Our method uses a CLIP-based loss and an identity loss to manipulate images via user-supplied text prompts without changing any of the irrelevant attributes. Unlike previous work, our method requires only 12 seconds of optimization per text prompt and can be used with any pre-trained StyleGAN2 model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with extensive results and comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  title={Controlled Cue Generation for Play Scripts (Best Paper Award)},
  author={Alara Dirik* and Hilal Donmez* and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={We propose the novel task of theatrical cue generation from dialogues. Using our play scripts dataset, which consists of 775K lines of dialogue and 277K cues, we approach the problem of cue generation as a controlled text generation task and show how cues can be used to amplify the impact of dialogue using a language model conditioned on a dialogue/cue discriminator. In addition, we explore the use of topic keywords and emotions to drive cue generation. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that language models can be successfully used to generate plausible and attribute-controlled text in highly specialized domains such as theater play scripts.},

  title={Graph2Pix: A Graph-Based Image to Image Translation Framework},
  author={Dilara Gokay* and Enis Simsar* and Efehan Atici and Atif Emre Yilmaz and Alper Ahmetoglu and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a graph-based image-to-image translation framework for generating images. We use rich data collected from the popular creativity platform Artbreeder, where users interpolate multiple GAN-generated images to create artworks. This unique approach of creating new images leads to a tree-like structure where one can track historical data about the creation of a particular image. Inspired by this structure, we propose a novel graph-to-image translation model called Graph2Pix, which takes a graph and corresponding images as input and generates a single image as output. Our experiments show that Graph2Pix is able to outperform several image-to-image translation frameworks on benchmark metrics, including LPIPS (with a 25% improvement) and human perception studies (n=60), where users preferred the images generated by our method 81.5% of the time.},

  abstract={Recent research showed that it is possible to find directions in the latent spaces of pre-trained GANs. These directions provide controllable generation and support a wide range of semantic editing operations such as zoom-in or rotation. While existing works focus on discovering directions for semantic image editing, we focus on an abstract property: Creativity. Can we manipulate an image to make it more or less creative? We build our work on the largest AI-based creativity platform Artbreeder where users are able to generate unique images using pre-trained GAN models. We explore the latent dimensions of the images generated on this platform and present a novel framework for manipulating images to make them more creative.},

  title={FairStyle: Debiasing StyleGAN2 with Style Channel Manipulations},
  author={Cemre Efe Karakas* and Alara Dirik* and Eylul Yalcinkaya and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={Recent advances in generative adversarial networks have shown that it is possible to generate high-resolution and hyperrealistic images. However, the images produced by GANs are only as fair and representative as the datasets on which they are trained. In this paper, we propose a method for directly modifying a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model that can be used to generate a balanced set of images with respect to one (e.g., eyeglasses) or more attributes (e.g.,  gender and eyeglasses). Our method takes advantage of the style space of the StyleGAN2 model to perform disentangled control of the target attributes to be debiased. Our method does not require training additional models and directly debiases the GAN model, paving the way for its use in various downstream applications. Our experiments show that our method successfully debiases the GAN model within a few minutes without compromising the quality of the generated images.  },

  title={Text and Image Guided 3D Avatar Generation and Manipulation},
  author={Zehranaz Canfes* and Furkan Atasoy* and Alara Dirik* and Pinar Yanardag},
  abstract={The manipulation of latent space has recently become an interesting topic in the field of generative models. Recent research shows that latent directions can be used to manipulate images towards certain attributes. However, controlling the generation process of 3D generative models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D manipulation method that can manipulate both the shape and texture of the model using text or image-based prompts such as 'a young face' or  'a surprised face'. We leverage the power of  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model and a pre-trained 3D GAN model designed to generate face avatars, and create a fully differentiable rendering pipeline to manipulate meshes. More specifically, our method takes an input latent code and modifies it such that the target attribute specified by a text or image prompt is present or enhanced, while leaving other attributes largely unaffected. Our method requires only 5 minutes per manipulation, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with extensive results and comparisons. },
